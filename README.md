# Retro-V v1.0
Retro-V is a SoftCPU in Verilog from Shaos that implements RISC-V 32-bit architecture RV32I,
but with 8-bit databus to look like retro 8-bit microprocessor suitable for DIY computers
(like "nedoPC-5" for example: https://gitlab.com/nedopc/npc5), capable of passing
RV32I compliance tests, compatible with RTOS Zephyr and distributed as fully open
sourced Verilog soft core under Apache License:
